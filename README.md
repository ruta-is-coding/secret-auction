# Secret Auction

Day 9 project from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu

### Rules:
- A secret auction is a type of auction where the bidders submit their bids privately, without knowing the bids of others.
- Each player provides their name and bid amount.
- After each bid, the player is asked, "Are there any other bidders?" If the player types "yes," the screen clears, and the next bidder can enter their information.
- If "no" is entered, the bidding ends.
- The player with the highest bid is declared the winner, and their bid amount is announced.
